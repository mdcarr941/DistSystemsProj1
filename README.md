# Instructions
Invoke the solver from the command line by calling
`mix run proj1.exs N k`
from the project's directory, where N and k are non-negative integers
whose semantics are described in the problem statement.

You may also invoke the solver from elixir by calling
`Proj1.run(N, k)`

There is a suite of tests included with the project which you can run with
`mix test` from the project's directory.
